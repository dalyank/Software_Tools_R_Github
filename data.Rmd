## **What is the Data and Metadata?**

Data are things, known or assumed as facts, making the basis of reasoning or calculation.

  ![](Presentation/datum.png)

Metadata is information about data.

***

## **Data Collection and Generation**

Data collection is the process of gathering and measuring information on targeted variables in an established system. The purpose is to answer relevant questions or/and evaluate outcomes.

* Observational 
* Statistical 
* Simulation

## **Data Assimilation and Manipulation**

Data assimilation is a mathematical discipline that seeks to optimally combine theory with observations. 

![](Presentation/data_assim.jpeg)

Data manipulation; inserting, deleting, and modifying data in a database.

***

## **Data Science**

Data science is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge from structured and unstructured data.

  - **Data Formats**


***

### **Data Types**

- Vector
    - Point
    - Line
    - Polygon

- Raster

- Gridded

***

### **Vector Data**

Vector data structures represent specific features on the Earthâ€™s surface, and assign attributes to those features.

![](Presentation/vector_type.png) ![](Presentation/vector_type_1.jpg)

***

### **BONUS - Point to Polygon**

Thiessen polygon 

![](Presentation/th_1.gif) ![](Presentation/th_2.gif) ![](Presentation/th_3.gif)

It defines an area around a point, where every location is nearer to this point than to all the others (2D).

***

### **Raster Data**

Rasters are made up of a matrix of pixels (also called cells), each containing a value that represents the conditions for the area covered by that cell.

***

### **Gridded Data**

- A multi-dimensional rectangular or square-shaped
- The array of grid 
- Borders and points which are containing values

### **BONUS - Numerical weather prediction (NWP)**

NWP uses mathematical models of the atmosphere and oceans to predict the weather based on current weather conditions.

***

### **Data Set**

- Observation

- Forecast

- Re-Analysis Data

- Ensamble Data


***

### **Observation Data**

The information collected by a primary source.

![](Presentation/observation_data.png)

***

### **Forecast**

The process of making predictions of the future based on past and present data. 

![](Presentation/forecast.png)


***

### **Re-Analysis Data**

A scientific method for developing a comprehensive record.
Observations and a numerical model are combined objectively.

![](Presentation/reanalysis.jpg)



***

### **Ensamble Data**

Instead of making a single forecast, a set (or ensemble) of forecasts. 
This set of forecasts aims to give an indication of the range of possible future states of the atmosphere.
