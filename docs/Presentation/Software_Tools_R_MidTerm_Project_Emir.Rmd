# **Instructions**

### **PART-1 Download, Get or Find and Read Data**

<span style="color:brown">R-STUDIO AND DATA</span>

1. Go to the [webpage](https://emirtoker.github.io/Software_Tools_R_Github/index.html) of the course
2. Open Data "Istanbul_Goztepe_Mean_Temperature_1839-2013_Monthly" (.dat) by click the LINK
3. Copy and Paste it in your "Downloads" directory in a text file with ".dat" extension
4. Open your R-Studio, Create an R-Project, Create an R-Script (*you will write and save your all codes from now in this script*), and try to read the data file with each of these ways:

<span style="color:brown">WAY 1</span> - **GO TO FILE**

5. Check your Project Name and your Working directory
6. Go to "Downloads" directory in R-Studio, using console
7. List files and Read Data with three different read functions ( *read.csv(), read.delim(), read.table()*)
8. Choose the best for you ( *or change the options if it is necessary, regarding header or separators* )
9. Assign your data as "temp_1"

<span style="color:brown">WAY 2</span> - **CALL THE FILE**

10. Go Back to your Working directory
11. Define your data file path with file.path() ( *remember, you downloaded the data in your Downloads folder* )
12. Assign the path a new variable as "path_my_file"
13. Use your best read...() function to read the file with "path_my_file"
14. Assign your data as "temp_2"

<span style="color:brown">WAY 3</span> - **IMPORT THE FILE**

15. Use "Import Datase"
16. Chose "From Text (base)" option
17. Try to assign your data as "temp_3" at this time

<span style="color:brown">WAY 4</span> - **GET THE FILE (WITH URL)**

18. Copy the LINK of data
19. Use your best read() function
20. Read the file with this function and LINK
21. Assign your data as "temp_4"

<span style="color:brown">LAST STEP</span>

22. Choose your favorite data ( *temp_1, temp_2, temp_3 or temp_4* ) and assign as just "**temp**"


### **PART-2 Play with the Data**

<span style="color:brown">MEET WITH THE DATA</span>

1. Look at class and structure
2. Learn attributes and dimensions
3. Rename attributes ( *ex: Months for each column and years for each raw* ) ( *attributes() and month.name or month.abb* )

* ***By the way, your data have to include just temperature values when you print it. Years and months have to be just attributes of data.***

<span style="color:brown">CLEAR **NA** AND CHOOSE COLUMN</span>

4. Print "temp". Do you see irrelevant numbers ? If so, change them as **NA**

* ***Now your "temp" data must seem like this***


```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
download.file(url = "https://web.itu.edu.tr/~tokerem/temp.png",
          destfile = "temp.png",
          mode = 'wb')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "temp.png")
```


5. Delete rows which include NA ( *which() or na.omit()* )

* ***Now your "temp" data must seem like this***

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
download.file(url = "https://web.itu.edu.tr/~tokerem/temp1.png",
          destfile = "temp1.png",
          mode = 'wb')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "temp1.png")
```


6. Assign it as new "temp" again
7. Select summer season 
8. Assign it as "temp_summer" ( *three months*)


<span style="color:brown">USE LOGICAL OPERATORS</span>

9. Compare June and July: Find and print the years when June temperatures were **less than** July. ( *which()* )
10. Calculate mean temperature for each months (*you will probably need the* ***na.rm*** *(NA Remove)* *option* ) and assign it as "avg_month"
11.
  a) Print minimum and maximum values for “avg_month”
  b) Find which year and which month minimum and maximum values were observed12. Calculate the mean temperature for each years (*you will probably need the* ***na.rm*** *(NA Remove)* *option* ) "avg_year"
12. Calculate the mean temperature of all data and assign it as "avg_temp" and print it
13. Print the years of "avg_year" **which** are **greater than or equal to** "avg_temp"

<span style="color:brown">PLOT</span>

14. Plot temperature for June ( *for each year* ), add title and unit
15. Edit y-axis and x-axis label ( *to see which years are they* )
16. What about July and August ? Plot them on the same figure with June.
17. Is there any strangeness thing, what do you think ? Compare three plots
18. Plot "avg_month", make the type of line as "line" and colorful. What is reason of the *inverted V letter* shape
19. Plot "avg_year", make the line dashed line. What do you think 
20. Plot just temperature for just 1990 ( *my birth year* )

<span style="color:brown">THE LAST BUT NOT LEAST</span>

21. **Run these codes.** Can you explain what am I doing with my codes which were given below? What are these x-axis and y-axis in here? ( *which years or months are they?* ) What is the result of this figure, what do you see and what do you think? what do colors mean? Can you edit title and x-axis and y-axis labels?

```
plot(seq(1,12),  temp[142,1:12] , type = "l", col = "red")
lines(seq(1,12), temp[1,1:12]   , type = "l", col = "blue")
legend("topleft",c("blue","red"),fill=c("blue","red"))
abline(h = mean(colMeans(temp, na.rm = T)))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
download.file(url = "https://web.itu.edu.tr/~tokerem/temp2.png",
          destfile = "temp2.png",
          mode = 'wb')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "temp2.png")
```



```
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))    #or try par(mfrow = c(4, 1))
plot(ylim = c(0,30), rowMeans(temp[,9:11])      , type="l", col="orange")
plot(ylim = c(0,30), rowMeans(temp[,c(12,1,2)]) , type="l", col="blue")
plot(ylim = c(0,30), rowMeans(temp[,3:5])       , type="l", col="green")
plot(ylim = c(0,30), rowMeans(temp[,6:8])       , type="l", col="red")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
download.file(url = "https://web.itu.edu.tr/~tokerem/temp2.png",
          destfile = "temp2.png",
          mode = 'wb')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "temp2.png")
```
