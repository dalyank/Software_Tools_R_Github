## What is the Data and Metadata?

Data are things, known or assumed as facts, making the basis of reasoning or calculation.

  ![](datum.png)

Metadata is information about data.

## Metadata

## Data Collection and Generation

Data collection is the process of gathering and measuring information on targeted variables in an established system. The purpose is to answer relevant questions or/and evaluate outcomes.

* Observational 
* Statistical 
* Simulation

![](generate.png)

## Data Types

In computer science and computer programming, a **data type** or simply **type** is an attribute of data.

![](r-programming-data-types.png) ![](what_data.svg){ width=30% }

What is the programmer's purpose? 

What is the nature of the data?

## Data Formats

* Text, Picture, Audio, Video
* File; pdf, txt, csv, html, xml, nc, hdf
* Point, Line, Polygon
* 1D, 2D, 3D, xD

## Data Analysis

Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions and supporting decision-making.

![](data_analytics.png) ![](datashape.jpg)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods.

![](eda.png)

## Big Data

Too large or complex data to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application and software.

![](apache_point.jpg) ![](alma.jpg)

ALMA, Atacama, Antofagasta Region, Chile

## Apache Point, New Mexico, US, 1995

After **one month**, the 'apache point' collected astronomical data as much as we have since the beginning of the earth.

After **ten years**, it collected data as much as we have. (not only astronomically, all data)

![](apache_point.jpg)

Important because of the golden rate.

## ALMA, Atacama, Antofagasta Region, Chile, 2011

66 high-precision antennas (over 100 tons for each), like 1 big teleschope. The antennas can be moved across the desert plateau over distances from 150 m to 16 km.

Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, ALMA Transporter (130-ton) and Correlator (1.5 trillion/sec)

In 5 days it collects data as much as we have. Also we found the Black Body. 

## Data Mining

Data mining is the process of discovering patterns in large data sets.

![](mining1.jpg){ width=42% } ![](mining.jpg)

## Data Assimilation and Manipulation

Data assimilation is a mathematical discipline that seeks to optimally combine theory with observations. 

![](data_assim_00.png){ width=40% }  ![](data_manip.jpg){ width=31% } 

Data manipulation; inserting, deleting, and modifying data in a database.

Chemical and Physical

## Data Science

Data science is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge from structured and unstructured data.

## Operational Systems

An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

![](os.png)

Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, Linux 

## Programming Languages

Programming language is a formal language and used in computer programming to implement algorithms.

Top 20 (256) most popular programming (2019-2020)

## Interpretation and Visualization

Interpretation is the process of making sense of the data that has been collected, analyzed, and presented. 

Visualization is the graphical representation of information and data.

![](visual.jpg)


##  Algorithm 

The algorithm is a set of instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or perform a computation.

![](algorithm.png)

## Simulation 

The simulation is an approximate imitation of the operation of a process or system; that represents its operation over time.

![](simulation.jpg)


## Modelling

Model is a description of a system using mathematical concepts. The aim of modeling is to understand easier a particular part or feature of thing.

![](model.png)

##  Popular Terms About Programming

-	Artificial İntelligence
-	Machine Learning
-	Deep Learning
-	Internet of Things

##  Artificial İntelligence

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning and self-correction.

![](ai.png)

##  Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions.

![](machine.jpg)

##  Deep Learning

Deep learning is part of a family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks.

![](deep.jpg)

##  Internet of Things

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines. IoT has the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.
