## What is the Data and Metadata?

Data are things, known or assumed as facts, making the basis of reasoning or calculation.

  ![](datum.png)

Metadata is information about data.

## Metadata

## Data Collection and Generation

Data collection is the process of gathering and measuring information on targeted variables in an established system. The purpose is to answer relevant questions or/and evaluate outcomes.

* Observational 
* Statistical 
* Simulation

## Data Analysis

Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions and supporting decision-making.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods.

## Big Data

Too large or complex data to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application and software.

## Data Mining

Data mining is the process of discovering patterns in large data sets.

## Data Assimilation and Manipulation

Data assimilation is a mathematical discipline that seeks to optimally combine theory with observations. 

![](data_assim.jpeg)

Data manipulation; inserting, deleting, and modifying data in a database.


## Data Science

Data science is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge from structured and unstructured data.

## Operational Systems

An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

![](os.png)

Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, Linux 

## Programming Languages

![](languages.png)


##  Algorithm 

The algorithm is a set of instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or perform a computation.

![](algorithm.png)

## Simulation 

The simulation is an approximate imitation of the operation of a process or system; that represents its operation over time.

![](simulation.jpg)


## Modelling

Model is a description of a system using mathematical concepts. The aim of modeling is to understand easier a particular part or feature of thing.

##  Popular Terms About Programming

-	Artificial İntelligence
-	Machine Learning
-	Deep Learning
-	Internet of Things

##  Artificial İntelligence

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning and self-correction.

![](ai.png)

##  Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions.

![](machine.jpg)

##  Deep Learning

Deep learning is part of a family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks.

![](deep.jpg)

##  Internet of Things

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines. IoT has the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.
