### **What is R?**

R is a **language**. It is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.

![](Presentation/R_logo.jpeg) ![](Presentation/gnu_logo_small.png)

It is a **GNU project**.

UNIX, Windows and MacOS

*R version 3.6.1 has been released on 2019-07-05*

***

### **R History**

- **Bell Laboratories** are used for industrial research and scientific development.
- **S** is a statistical programming language, by John Chambers, Bell Laboratories, New Jersey, 1975–1976.
- **R** was created by **R**oss Ihaka and **R**obert Gentleman, (statisticians), **GNU** public license, the University of Auckland, New Zealand, 1992.

### **Milestones of R**

- 1991 - Statistical Models in S (White Book) was published.
- 1997 - The oldest R source was released on The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).
- 1997 - 3 mirrors and 12 packages.
- 1997 - R becomes an official part of the GNU Project.
- 1999 - "*update.packages*" and "*install.packages*" functions.
- 2001 - The first version for Mac OS X.
- 2010 - Support for Windows 64 bit systems.
- 2013 - Support for numeric index values 2^31 and larger on 64 bit systems.
- 2017 - Just-in-time compilation (JIT) of functions and loops (10 to 20 times faster).

*almost 20 years, and more than 10,000 R packages*

## **Fields of Usage**


- **Data analysis**
    - Interpretation
    - Visualization
    - Manipulation

- **Statistical techniques**
    - Linear and nonlinear regression (or modelling)
    - Classical statistical tests
    - Time-series analysis
    - Classification and Clustering

***

### **Interpretation**

The process of making sense out of a collection of data.

![](Presentation/r_inter.png)

***

### **Visualization**

Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data.

![](Presentation/r_visual.png)


***

### **Visualization**

*storms*


***

### **Manipulation**

The process of changing data to make it easier to read or be more organized.

![](Presentation/r_dplyr.png)

*R dplyr scheme*


***

### **Linear and nonlinear Regression (or Modelling)**

Linear functions are those whose graph is a straight line.

y = f(x) = a + bx

Regression is a statistical method used to create a model.

![](Presentation/r_linear.png)



***

### **Classical statistical tests**

Describe the distribution of data and to determine the reliability of a sample drawn from a population.

![](Presentation/r_classic1.png) ![](Presentation/r_classic2.png)

***Statistical significance tests** is used to inform judgments regarding whether the hypothesis is false or not false*


***

### **Time-series analysis**

Time series is a series of data points in which each data point is associated with a timestamp.

![](Presentation/r_time.gif)



***

### **Classification and Clustering**

Classification and Clustering are characterize objects into groups by one or more features. 

![](Presentation/r_clust.jpg)

***Classification** is used in a supervised learning technique which include predefined properties. **Clustering** is used in unsupervised learning based on group properties.*


***

### **Correlation analysis**

The measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.

![](Presentation/r_corr.png)



***

### **Fields of Usage**

- **Facebook** – Update status and social network graph.
- **Google** – Calculate Return on Investment (ROI), predict the economic activity, improve the efficiency of online advertising.
- **New York Times** – Prepare graphics before printing.
- **Twitter** – R is part of Twitter’s Data Science toolbox for sophisticated statistical modeling.

## Comments

How to tell R to ignore a part of your code? (**#**)

![](Presentation/r_screen24.png)

***

### Comments

- Help yourself and other people to reading the code and understand it faster:

```
# This code will calculate the likelihood that it will rain tomorrow

  complicated_rain_calculation_for_tomorrow()
```

- Ignore a line of code and see how a program will run without it:

```
# value <- old_code()

  value <- new_code()
```

## Save Your Script

![](Presentation/r_screen25.png)

- RStudio is an interface

- Script is a passive text

- Console is an interactive decoding area

- Math is pre-defined
